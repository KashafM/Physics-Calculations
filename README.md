# Physics-Calculations
This application uses many functions to solve several mathematical and physics related problems. 

In the first section, the program is calculating the skid distance of a vehicle given certain parameters. 
In the second section, the program is solving for the zeros of given domains using the fzero function. 
In the third section, the program is again solving for the roots using the roots function. 
Finally, in the fourth section implements the a secondary file to solve a non-linear equation.
